Change Log
==========

## Version 1.0.0

* **New**: added `GridPadPlacementPolicy` class that used to control implicit placement policy
  for items
* **New**: added `GridPadDiagnosticLogger` diagnostic class to receive information about skipped
  items
* **API Change**: to `GridPad` added `placementPolicy` property
* **API Change**: `GridPadScope.item()` split to two methods - explicit and implicit
* **Behavior Change**: implicit placement of elements depends on `placementPolicy` property
* **Behavior Change**: span expands depends on `placementPolicy` property

The new API shouldn't affect your code by default. Only one case can be affected by library 
update - cases when only one of the `row` or `column` parameters was defined in GridPad.item. 
This way of using is no more acceptable for not enough clear behavior reasons.
